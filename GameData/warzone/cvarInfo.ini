[DESCRIPTION]
r_ao=Ambient occlusion is a shading and rendering technique used to calculate how exposed each point in a scene is to ambient lighting.

r_shadowBlur=Soft Shadows is a method for smoothing the edge of shadows to reduce distortion errors and generally just look better.

r_dynamicGlow=Dynamic Glow adds flares around light sources.

r_bloom=Bloom increases the size and strength of the flares around light sources. Bloom rays adds volumetric light and shadows to all light sources.

r_anamorphic=Anamorphic Lens Flares add a long horizontal flare to light sources.

r_ssdm=Screen Space Displacement Mapping is a faster alternative to parallax mapping. It adds a 3D effect to surfaces, much faster then traditional parallax methods.

r_cartoon=Cartoon Mode turns the game into a cartoon!

r_ssdo=Screen Space Directional Occlusion is an enhancement to lighting that reduces the strength of lighting where the area is blocked by objects on the screen.

r_sss=Screen Space Shadows are a method of drawing shadows, without the need for any additional geometry drawing. It is inaccurate, but faster then traditional shadow methods. This effect is experimental in Star Wars: Warzone.

r_deferredLighting=Deferred Lighting is a technique used to light the game in post processing. It greatly speeds up rendering by only doing light calculations on the final pixels drawn on the screen.

r_ssr=Screen Space Reflections are a method of drawing reflections on the screen in post processing.

r_sse=Screen Space Emissive Lighting is a method of drawing light reflections in post processing.

r_magicdetail=Magic Detail is a method of adding more detail and 3D depth to objects on the screen, while being very fast.

r_hbao=Horizon-Based Ambient Occlusion is a shading and rendering technique used to calculate how exposed each point in a scene is to ambient lighting. This technique has a much higher rendering cost than normal Ambient Occlusion.

r_glslWater=Screen Space Water is a method used to create realistic, 3 dimensional water in screen space.

r_fogPost=Fog and/or Volumetric Fog.

r_dof=Depth Of Field tries to mimic cameras and the human eye, by emphasizing the subject while de-emphasizing the foreground and background.

r_lensflare=Lens Flares make a flare appear when looking directly at a bright object.

r_colorCorrection=Color Corection adjusts the colors of the world. Currently disabled by default in Star Wars: Warzone.

r_esharpening=Sharpening sharpens the screen image to make objects look more detailed.

r_esharpening2=Alternative Sharpening sharpens the screen image to make objects look more detailed.

r_darkexpand=Dark Xpand adds more depth to objects on the screen, and reduces aliasing.

r_distanceBlur=Distance Blur blurs distant objects in order to emphasize close objects, similar Depth Of Field. This is static, but faster than Depth Of Field.

r_volumeLight=Volumetric Lighting is a technique used in 3D computer graphics to add lighting effects to a rendered scene. It allows the viewer to see beams of light shining through the environment; seeing sunbeams streaming through an open window is an example of volumetric lighting, also known as crepuscular rays.

r_fxaa=Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing is a technique to remove aliasing of edges on the screen, unlike slower methods, it ignores polygons and line edges, and simply analyses the pixels on the final screen image. It is a pixel shader program that runs every frame in a scant millisecond or two.

r_txaa=TXAA is a new film–style anti–aliasing technique designed specifically to reduce temporal aliasing (crawling and flickering seen in motion when playing games). This technology is a mix of a temporal filter, hardware anti–aliasing, and custom CG film–style anti–aliasing resolves.

r_showdepth=Show Depth is for developers. It displays the depth of the screen pixels from the viewer.

r_shownormals=Show Normals is for developers. It displays the final normals of the screen pixels.

r_trueAnaglyph=Anaglyph 3D is the name given to the stereoscopic 3D effect achieved by means of encoding each eye's image using filters of different (usually chromatically opposite) colors, red and cyan. Anaglyph 3D images contain two differently filtered colored images, one for each eye. This requires red/blue glasses.

r_occlusion=Occlusion Culling is a feature that disables rendering of objects when they are not currently seen by the camera because they are obscured (occluded) by other objects.
